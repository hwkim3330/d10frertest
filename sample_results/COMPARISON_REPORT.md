# FRER vs Non-FRER Latency Comparison

## Test Configuration

- **Samples:** 1000 per path
- **Path 1:** Avg 0.40ms, Jitter 0.15ms (Primary)
- **Path 2:** Avg 0.45ms, Jitter 0.12ms (Secondary)
- **FRER Mode:** Minimum selection

## Results Summary

| Metric | Path 1 | Path 2 | FRER | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------|------|-------------|
| Min (ms) | 0.150 | 0.150 | 0.150 | +0.0% |
| Avg (ms) | 0.402 | 0.451 | 0.351 | +12.7% |
| Max (ms) | 0.873 | 0.952 | 0.736 | +15.8% |
| P50 (ms) | 0.403 | 0.450 | 0.354 | +12.1% |
| P90 (ms) | 0.577 | 0.596 | 0.492 | +14.8% |
| P95 (ms) | 0.643 | 0.637 | 0.526 | +18.1% |
| P99 (ms) | 0.741 | 0.737 | 0.589 | +20.5% |
| P99.9 (ms) | 0.864 | 0.810 | 0.694 | +19.7% |
| Jitter (ms) | 0.141 | 0.118 | 0.109 | +22.5% |

## Key Improvements

- **Average Latency:** +12.73% improvement
- **P99 Latency:** +20.53% improvement
- **Jitter Reduction:** +22.54% reduction

## FRER Benefits

1. **Lower Average Latency**
   - FRER always selects the faster path
   - Average improvement of 10-20%

2. **Reduced Tail Latency**
   - P99 and P99.9 significantly improved
   - Better worst-case performance

3. **Lower Jitter**
   - More consistent latency
   - Path delay variance compensation

4. **Reliability**
   - Automatic failover if one path fails
   - Zero downtime
